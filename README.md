# Recommender-Systems
This repo was developed with a focus on developing an accurate as well as an efficient recommender system for my chatbot (Hence, the name conversational recommender system). There were certain problems that I faced while developing the chatbot such as maintaining the context of the conversation, cold start problem, etc., and these issues also halted the further development of the recommender systems also. Nevertheless, even though I have stopped maintaining it, these novice attempts can be revisited to improve upon later.
